# Contact

I would love to connect with more people and read what they have to say. Please
feel free to contact me if you want me to read your blog, share your ideas, or
ask me about something. If you think I am wrong about something, please let me
know!

The best way to reach me is via email at [me@ezrizhu.com](mailto:me@ezrizhu.com).\
If you wish to send encrypted email to me, I have a PGP key
[0xC15ECEC52397343B](/files/publickey.asc).

For a more asynchronous chat, I usually idle in Libera IRC under the nick
`ezrizhu`. My Discord is `ezrizhu`. Discord will automatically
reject requests if you're not in a mutual server with me, feel free to join the
[Rust Programming Language Community
Server](https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community) if you need a mutual.

I currently live in the New York Metropolitan Area (Hoboken and Queens), so my
timezone is the U.S. Eastern Time Zone (GMT-5), with daylight savings time
(GMT-4) from March to November.
