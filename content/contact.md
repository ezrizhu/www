# Contact

I would love to connect with more people and read what they have to say. Please
feel free to contact me if you want me to read your blog, share your ideas, or
ask me about something. If you think I am wrong about something, please let me
know!

The best way to reach me is via email at
[me@ezrizhu.com](mailto:me@ezrizhu.com).

You can encrypt your communications to me via [age](https://age-encryption.org)
using my [ssh keys](https://ezri.pub). (more preferred)

I also have a PGP key [0xD62AB51EF84ACA4B](/files/publickey.asc) (wkd is also
setup on this domain), should you wish to use pgp.

You may also send a S/MIME encrypted email to
[ezri@basednetworking.com](mailto:ezri@basednetworking.com) with my S/MIME cert
below.

* [my S/MIME cert](/files/ezri_zhu.crt)
* [DigiCert Signing Cert](/files/DigiCertCA.crt)
* [DigiCert Root CA](/files/TrustedRoot.crt)

Backup email if above doesn't work:

* [ezri@tuta.com](mailto:ezri@tuta.com)
* [ezrizhu@icloud.com](mailto:ezrizhu@icloud.com)
* [ezrizhu@gmail.com](mailto:ezrizhu@gmail.com)

University/work email can be provided on request.

Some of my online identities can be verified against my pgp key via
[keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org/wkd/me@ezrizhu.com).
