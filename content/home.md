# Hey, I'm a student interested in software **development**, computer **networking**, managing **infrastructure** at **scale**, **cybersecurity**, and **DevOps**

I am a rising sophomore at [Stevens Institute of
Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science)
pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I'm currently working
with [Michael Greenberg](https://greenberg.science/) and the rest of the [PaSH
Team](https://binpa.sh/) on [a speculative execution engine for the
shell](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/liargkovas.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy playing a variety of video games, watching anime,
reading, writing my blog, and exploring the city. You can find what my current
focuses are, what I'm reading, watching, and what I have been playing on my [now
page](/now).
