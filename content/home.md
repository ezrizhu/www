My name is *Ezri Zhu*, I am a rising senior at the [Stevens Institute of
Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science)
pursuing a degree in *Computer Science* and a minor in *Economics*. I'm
currently working with [Prof. Michael Greenberg](https://greenberg.science/) and
the rest of the [PaSH Team](https://binpa.sh/) on [*a speculative execution
engine for the
shell*](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/liargkovas.pdf). As
well as with [Prof. Ethan Katz-Bassett](https://www.columbia.edu/~ebk2141/) from
[Columbia EE](https://www.ee.columbia.edu/) on [*the PEERING
testbed*](https://peering.ee.columbia.edu).

In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing my blog, and skateboarding around the
city. You can find what my current focuses are, what I'm reading, watching, and
what I have been playing on my [now page](/now).
