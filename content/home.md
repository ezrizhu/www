# Hey, I'm a student interested in software **development**, computer
**networking**, managing **infrastructure** at **scale**, **cybersecurity**, and
**DevOps**.

I am a rising sophomore at [Stevens Institute of
Technology](https://www.stevens.edu/school-engineering-science/departments/computer-science)
pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I'm currently working
with [Michael Greenberg](https://greenberg.science/) and the rest of the [PaSH
Team](https://binpa.sh/) on [a speculative execution engine for the
shell](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2023/papers/liargkovas.pdf).

In my free time, I enjoy playing a variety of video games, [watching
anime](https://myanimelist.net/anime/47917/Bocchi_the_Rock), reading, writing my
blog, and exploring the city. Recently I have been playing
[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com), [The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
Kingdom](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch/),
[Black Mesa](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/), and
[Counter Strike: Global
Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/).
