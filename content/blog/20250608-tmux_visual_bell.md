[Terminal bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_character) are a neat way
for command-line applications to ping the user about something. It's the 'ding'
that you hear on your terminal sometimes when you're tabbing around or when you
run this.

```
printf '\a'
```

In tmux, you can enable visual bell via the `bell-action` and the `visual-bell`
option, but it is not super pretty, we can do better than that.

So I wrote this script that has tmux bark at you whenever any window under any
session gets a bell, using tmux's `display-popup`, it also shows you the tmux
session and window that sent the bell.

To use it, you can just save this script somewhere, I use home-manager's
home.file to write it for me. I used the path `~/.config/tmux/bell.sh`

```
#!/bin/sh
SESSION="$1"
WINDOW="$2"
tmux display-popup -x P -y P -w 40 -h 3 -t . \
    "echo -n 'ðŸ¦´ awrf~ awrf~ $SESSION:$WINDOW ðŸ¦´'" &
(sleep 1 && tmux display-popup -C) &
```

then in your tmux's config file,

```
set-option -g bell-action any
set-option -g visual-bell off
set-hook -g alert-bell "run-shell '~/.config/tmux/bell.sh \"#S\" \"#W\"'"
```

This is a pretty short blog, but I think it's pretty neat and I hope you enjoyed
it. At first I thought to make a tmux plugin but this also works.
