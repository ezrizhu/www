I have decided that I'll give Nix a go, since a team I am on will be using it.

I think for simple deployments, Nix saves me the hassle of installing new
systems by allowing me to define the entire server in just a few files.

It was pretty nice, I shall paste my boilerplate Nix config here for my future
use.

```nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports =
    [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
      ./hardware-configuration.nix
      ./thelounge.nix
    ];

  boot.loader.grub.enable = true;
  boot.loader.grub.device = "/dev/vda"; # or "nodev" for efi only

  networking.hostName = "nixplay"; # Define your hostname.
  networking.search = ["bns.sh"];
  networking.nameservers = [ "9.9.9.10" "149.112.112.10" ];
  time.timeZone = "America/New_York";
  i18n.defaultLocale = "en_US.UTF-8";
  users.users.ezri = {
     isNormalUser = true;
     extraGroups = [ "wheel" ];
     openssh.authorizedKeys.keys  = [
       "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIN2whKHD8XCH+CQwnagH+iBfkyjc/2f/QEfdsEi0SaKO t2"
     ];
   };
   environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
     vim
     wget
     curl
   ];
  virtualisation = {
    podman = {
      enable = true;
      dockerCompat = true;
      defaultNetwork.settings.dns_enabled = true;
    };
  };
  services.openssh.enable = true;
  system.stateVersion = "23.05";
  nix.settings.experimental-features = [ "nix-command" "flakes" ];
  swapDevices = [ {
    device = "/swapfile";
    size = 4*1024;
    randomEncryption.enable = true;
  } ];

}
```

```nix
{
virtualisation.oci-containers.containers."thelounge" = {
  image = "thelounge/thelounge:latest";
  ports = [ "9000:9000" ];
  autoStart = true;
  volumes = [ "/etc/thelounge:/var/opt/thelounge" ];
};
}
```

I used `nixos-rebuild switch` to switch to the current config.

I also used `nix-store --gc` to cleanup.

In this current playground, I just deployed thelounge via podman.

I still need to figure out how to use flakes and some other things, but I like
it so far.

If this goes well, I might nix-ify my whole infrastructure.

Update (Nov 5): I just finished writing the Nix for the org I am working with (Stevens
Blueprint). [the nix files can be found
here](https://github.com/stevensblueprint/techops)

Currently it has Nginx, Dokuwiki, and Authelia SSO to reverse proxy Dokuwiki.
