I was inspired by [Manu’s I’ll read it](https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it).

I’d love to read your blog! For following three reasons.

* Meet new people, foster new connections
* Encourage people to write more
* See what others have to say about things

If you are afraid that you don’t have anything interesting to say, then write
about whatever is on your mind today.

If you are afraid that no one will read it, **I’ll read it**.

I can also read simplified Chinese, and would love to connect with more people
back in China.

So please, [send them over](mailto:me@ezrizhu.com).
