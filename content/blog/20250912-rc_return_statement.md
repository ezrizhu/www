## What's the Recurse Center?

> The [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) is a community of smart, nice,
thoughtful programmers of all experience levels, that you can join by applying
to do a six-, or 12-week self-directed retreat in NYC. People spend their time
at RC working on personal projects, exploring new areas of programming,
contributing to open source software, or anything else they’re interested in.

RC focuses on [three
self-directives](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-self-directives),

* Work at the edge of your abilities
* Build your volitional muscles
* Learn generously

Along with [four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules)

* No well-actually’s
* No feigned surprise
* No backseat driving
* No subtle -isms

> In addition to the retreat, RC works with over 150 partner companies to help
Recursers find programming jobs. The jobs team can help review your resume, set
you up with mock interviews, and give you advice about where you might fit in
best.


## Why did I join RC?

I joined RC for the Summer 1 2025 batch to spend my summer break. I'd known
about the Recurse Center for a few years from reading various people's
blogs[0] [1] [2] that mentioned it in their footers.

I wanted to attend RC because I want to be motivated by and surrounded with
other like-minded, passionate programmers. Most importantly, I wanted to be a part
of a wider community full of these like-minded, passionate people with their own
areas of experience, and nuances that I learn from.

## My time at RC

Throughout my time at the Recurse Center, I spent most of my time talking and
pairing on projects, however I also got a few things of my own done! Below are
some of those.

* Package/Fix various packages on
[nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pulls?q=author%3Aezrizhu)
* Paired with [Will](https://www.willbicks.com/) on a microcontroller that
bitbanged a HID Prox card signal to simulate a real HID Prox card. I learned so
much about how RFID technology works as well as using various tools like a
oscilloscope and a logic analyzer.
* Started various embedded projects featuring [nix flakes and esp32-idf with
embassy](https://ezrizhu.com/blog/esp32-rs-dev-flakes)
* [Custom tmux visual bell](https://ezrizhu.com/blog/tmux-visual-bell)
* Gotten more rigorous at programming, less handwaving things around

These projects are just the tangible outputs of my growth from RC. It's been a
few weeks since the end of my RC batch, but I am still trying to internalize how
inspired RC made me feel. I enjoyed computers so much more there. It was
refreshing to be in a space where everyone else is as passionate about computers
as me, surrounded by people who are happy to create art with computers. Coming
out of RC, one of the big takeaways I had was that you can just create things on
your own terms. It doesn't have to make your resume better. It doesn't have to
create value for shareholders. You can just make things for the sake of it.

At the Recurse Center, we had weekly internal talks where recursors can sign up
to give a 5-minute presentation. These presentations ranged from projects that
recursors have completed, to things recursors have just started and is looking
for feedback, or just a 5 minute technical rant. These presentations are a very
nice way for us to show off what we're working on to other recursors, in a
low-stress, welcoming environment. It is an extremely good way to keep yourself
accountable when you have a presentation deadline. However if you have a project
that you'd like to take longer than 5 minutes to present, we also have in-depth
presentations that allots for more time.

One of my favorite, long-running RC tradition is the weekly non-programming
talks. Non-programming talks have ranged from someone's journey to Antarctica as
a scientist, all the way to lockpicking. It is a great way for us as programmers to
gain exposure to other cool things that our world has to offer. It is also
something that even as an alum, an event that I still try to attend every week.

Every week, I try to go out on some outings with my batch in NYC every week,
whether it is another tech meetup like
[wordhack](https://toddwords.com/wordhack/), NYCResistor, or non-technical
outings such as getting lunch, dinner together, to visiting the Brooklyn
Botanical Garden.

RC also opens up its doors to the public for some events, such as
[Localhost](https://www.recurse.com/localhost). Localhost is a series of monthly
technical talks in NYC, given by members of the Recurse Center community.

The Lunch table at RC is a magical place, there are always people there talking
about interesting things, there are always interesting serendipitous
conversations that spawns there.

I'd say one of my biggest challenges coming into RC was how to manage my time.
I feel like I spend most of my time talking to people, getting nerd-sniped into
something everyday. That resulted in me not getting as much done as I'd hoped,
but I still feel very great about it as I feel like I am growing so much as a
programmer every day.

## End notes

Coming out of my RC batch, I feel very refreshed. I spoke to so many people
coming from all stages of their career, within and outside of computer science.
I get to be surrounded by so many pleasant people in NYC every day, and attended
a lot of events outside of the Recurse Center with other Recursors. I also feel
more confident as a programmer, as well as being more willing to work on my own
projects for fun. I am very happy that I will always be surrounded by the
amazing recurse community. I still go out to local NYC events in and around NYC
with recursors.

Recurse felt like a very defining moment in my technology career, I have always
been driven by RC's values of working at the edge of my abilities, learning new
things, as well as sharing what I have learned with others. Recurse taught me to
strengthen my volitional muscles, to learn to pick what I'd like to spend my
time and effort on.

I have also integrated the recurse social rules into how I
behave, I felt like the social rules made RC a especially friendly environment,
and I believe abiding by these rules will make me more friendly.

I’d be happy to tell you more about my experience at RC, or answer any questions
you have about applying :)

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to everyone that was at my RC batch for making it one of the most
memorable summer of my college years. I had a blast and I think this experience
really defined the rest of my career. I felt very refreshed and I am happy I
chose the field of computer science and attended RC this summer. I'd also like
to thank all the RC faculty for nurturing the space and the community.

And to everyone at the Recurse Center, whether you're an alum or in batch,
**Never Graduate!**
