Sorry it's been a while since I last wrote something, but I want to share
something I've been building!

I've been building a invite-only, shared, distributed NixOS system called
wolfgirl.systems.

Users are usually more trusted as it's an invite only community, so they will
have access to the nix daemon to install anything they want, like home-manager.

We're also requesting an ASN from ARIN and I have allocated a chunk of IPv6
space to the network, so users can spin up something like bird and experimenting
with announcing IPv6 space via our ASN, and it'd be routable from the world, as
most of our locations support BGP transit.

Users are also allowed to host their own websites, currently we're just pointing
/~username to a dir in their home directory, but in the future we plan on
supporting cgi-bins and forwarding http sockets.

In the future, I also plan on mounting a shared disk to all the machines, so
users will have access to a shared storage space across all of our machines.

You can find the docs, nixos config of wolfgirl.systems
[here](https://git.private.coffee/wolfgirls).

But yeah, that's all for now. Feel free to email me for an invite.
