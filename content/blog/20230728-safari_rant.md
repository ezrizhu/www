## The start of it all

So I was testing my new website css with my iPad since I can easily drag the
window size via stage manager. I opened my website in a private tab, and when I
was done with it, I pressed CMD-w, but it closed the whole safari window. I
thought it had just closed the private tab, so I re-opened safari, and I found
that all my other tabs had disappeared.

## The Panic

I started panicking, I remembered that if you go into the "Show All Windows"
page, it should have a button to recover the last deleted window.
Unfortunately, I don't know why, but it was not there...

I also remembered that if you hold down the plus key, it should show your
recently closed tabs. Great, it might be a bit of effort to reopen them all, but
I should still be able to recover them all, or so I thought. I held down the "+"
button, and it showed me only the list of tabs that **I had manually closed**...

I have come to accept that my 30 or so tabs that I wanted to read later are
gone, and I did not want to resort to going back to yesterday's iCloud backup.

## Lessons Learned

I'll start using tab groups for everything, they seem to persist for a while.
I used to use tab groups for everything due to the same reason, but I got lazy
and started to not use tab groups... Never again.
