I have been diving deeper into the whole indieweb scene and gotten some
inspirations from other people's blogs, and here are some changes.

I also saw [Manu's I'll read it page](https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it)
and reached out to him about my blog, he suggested a lot of fixes that were very
useful.

## What's New

* A [now page](/now) showing things I am doing right now.
* Projects now also support tags with the tech that I used.
* Added a call-to-email me link under every blog.

## What's Changed

* Links (with the only exception of the menu) are now underlined for
  accessibility. Visited links are now in a different color.
* Blog posts, index, and news are now wrapped to 85 characters, heading and
  paragraph spaces have also been increased for clarity.
* Link added to the webring so people can learn about it.
* Tag spacing in blog posts has also been improved to make them easier to click.

## Future Plans

* I think using something like rust's Arc(?), allow for runtime webring refresh,
  this will also lay the groundwork for other dynamic content like a comments
  section.
* Server side syntax highlighting for code blocks.
* And the other future plans from the bottom of [my last post about this
  website](https://ericz.me/blog/this-blog).
* Blog roll.
* Resume as html, with pdf link contained within
