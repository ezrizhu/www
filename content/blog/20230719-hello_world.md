This is the third revision of my website. My first website was a templated website from [html5up-proton]. My second website was a simple one-pager with my name, a line about what I do, and a few social links. This website, hopefully, the last revision, will do more, a lot more.

Right now, I have a homepage with an intro, some information from the news page, the projects page, social links, and this blog. I think that’s a fairly acceptable design, although it may be a bit cramped due to the amount of text. Perhaps I’ll revise the design later. Currently, I am thinking of publishing a blog article either weekly or fortnightly. Besides that, there’s the contact page, a list of my projects, and a link to my resume.

For my blog, I am thinking of mostly writing tech-related things that I encounter as I wander further down the path of computer science. But I don’t want to limit it to solely computer science; there are other things I want to write about. My motivation for this blog is to mainly document what I know and encourage myself to think things through more. I also think it’s time for me to have a broader presence on the internet and start contributing back with my blog and projects.
 
That’s it, this is a short introduction to my website and the blog. I hope people will enjoy it, and find something valuable from it. If you have any questions, thoughts, or ideas that you’d like to share, feel free to reach out to me!
