## What I'm reading

I am still slowly reading The Mythical Man-Month.

## What I'm playing

I have been getting back at playing [Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six:
Siege](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege) and [Counter
Strike: Global
Offensive](https://store.steampowered.com/app/730/CounterStrike_Global_Offensive/).

Recently I have also been playing on my classmate's
[Valorant](https://playvalorant.com/) premier team.

When I'm alone, I play [The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
Kingdom](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-switch/),
[Black Mesa](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362890/Black_Mesa/), and some
other games on my steam deck. Right now on the deck I'm playing [Coffee
Talk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/914800/Coffee_Talk/).

## What I'm listening to

* PostMatch by Kill Miami
* Ocean noises from my HomePod

S.W.A.T. the TV show, and I hope to get back to watching anime soon.
