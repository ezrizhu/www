Title: Stevens Students Webring
Description: An attempt at bringing back the forgotten technology known as webring.

---

Project Duration: July 2023 - Present

I first noticed a webring from a friend's website, it seemed pretty cool and
allowed me to discover other cool people on the internet. I thought about
starting my own webring, and I looked upon my university. A lot of us computer
science majors have a website.

I wrote the main webring API in rust, and my friend
[Josh](https://theautomata.net) wrote the javascript for the ring members.
