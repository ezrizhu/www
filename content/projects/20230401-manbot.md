Title: manpage discord bot
Description: discord bot that sends linux manpages in a discord thread

---

Project Duration: Apr 2023
Bot is still maintained, just not under active development.

I thought it'd be convenient when explain certain linux topics, to be able to
have the entire manual page linked in a discord chat. 

My friend eaic wrote man-api, and I wrote the discord bot in go that queries it
and sends the output in a nice discord embed in a thread.
