Project duration: Sep 2024


I wanted to try out microservices so I wrote a rust app that runs on
Cloudflare's [Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) platform, with
Cloudflare [R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/) for Object
Store, and [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv) for user credentials.
Everything the app has to communicate to is also on the edge, so the request
never have to leave the datacenter before going back to the user. This is
probably one of the fastest file hosts out there.

It includes a REST API to upload, replace, and delete objects. There is also a
web uploader that allows user to easily upload objects on the browser.
