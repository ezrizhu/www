Project duration: July 2024

My friends are all very competitive NYT Games players, and they post their
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) and
[Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) score every day in a
discord channel.

I thought it'd be fun and competitive if I made a leaderboard for each game. So
I made a discord bot that parses each score message, consisted of emojis, and
stored them in a simple json file. This sure made the server a lot more
competitive and every month the top of the scoreboard gets a prize.
